Problem 1: Defining a Simple Class
Task: Create a class named Student with the following properties: name (String), age (int), and grade (double).

Problem 2: Accessing and Modifying Class Properties
Task: Create an instance of the Student class, set its properties, and print them. Modify the grade property and print it again.

Problem 3: Constructor with Default Values
Task: Modify the Student class to have a constructor with default values for age (20) and grade (80.0).

Problem 4: Creating Methods
Task: Add a method named calculateGPA to the Student class that calculates and returns the student's GPA.

Problem 5: Calling Methods
Task: Create an instance of Student, call the calculateGPA method, and print the GPA.

Problem 6: Inheritance
Task: Create a subclass named UndergraduateStudent that inherits from the Student class and adds a property named major (String).

Problem 7: Method Overriding
Task: Override the calculateGPA method in the UndergraduateStudent class to use a specific GPA calculation based on the undergraduate grading system (e.g., consider letter grades and weight them accordingly).

Problem 8: Static Members

Task: Add a static property named currentYear to the Student class, initialize it to the current year, and create a static method named getUniqueID that generates and returns a unique identifier for each new student instance.


Problem 9: Accessing Static Members

Task: Access and print the currentYear value from the Student class without creating an instance.


Problem 10: Understanding the 'this' Keyword

Task: Modify the calculateGPA method in the UndergraduateStudent class to use the this keyword to reference the current instance's grade property within the method.
